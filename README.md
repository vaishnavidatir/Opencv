# Opencv
Basic programs of OpenCv which I done as part of my learning


# Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) . If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
   
```javascript
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Run


**For Window OS**


for setting Environment Variables in Windows Os refer this following Tutorial

**Attention:** Please perform the steps given in these tutorials at your own risk. Please don't mess up with the System Variables. It can potentially damage your PC. You should know what you're doing.

# Prerequisite:
 After setting Environmental Variable ,we need to install some Libraries that needed for our projects,to install libraries follow following steps:
 > Run command prompt as Administrator and install each library using following commands:
 * **Matplotlib** : Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. It                     provides an object-oriented API that helps in embedding plots in applications using Python GUI toolkits such as PyQt, WxPythonotTkinter. For showing multiple                     images in one window ,we are insatlling this library here.


                     ```javascript
                     pip install matplotlib
                     ```
 
* **Opencv** : OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision,with installation of opencv library Numerical Python library too get                      install so   no need to install numpy again . NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and                      matrices, along with a large     collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
               ```javascript
               pip install opencv-python
               ```
